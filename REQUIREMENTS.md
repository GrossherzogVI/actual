# Actual Budget++ Requirements Specification

> Generated from deep brainstorming session (112 questions, 6 rounds, 3 UX refinement passes).
> This document is the input for `/sc:design` (architecture) and implementation planning.

## 1. Product Vision

**"Finance OS"** — A daily-use personal finance command center that combines Finanzguru's ease of use, StarMoney's feature depth, AI automation, and full data sovereignty.

- **User**: Single power user (desktop-first, German financial context)
- **Usage**: Daily. Open like a cockpit, not a chore.
- **Design**: Dense, modern, premium feel. Fluid but information-rich. Not minimal consumer app — operational command center.
- **Philosophy**: The app gets smarter over time. Progressive automation reduces manual work from 20 items/week to 2-3 items/week.

## 2. Tech Stack (Existing — No Migration)

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite 7 | Monorepo: `packages/desktop-client/` |
| Styling | `@emotion/css` (CSS-in-JS) | NOT Tailwind. Premium feel via design tokens, not framework swap. |
| UI Primitives | `react-aria-components` | Accessible Button (`isDisabled`, `onPress`), Select, etc. |
| Component Library | `@actual-app/components` | View, Text, Button, Input, Card, Select, Menu, Popover, Toggle, Tooltip |
| Command Palette | `cmdk` v1.1.1 | Already exists as `CommandBar.tsx` — extend, don't rebuild |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | `react-hotkeys-hook` v5.2.4 | Already installed |
| Dashboard Layout | `react-grid-layout` v2.2.2 | Already installed — enables widget customization |
| Drag & Drop | `react-dnd` v16.0.1 | Already installed |
| Backend | Express 5 (sync-server) | `packages/sync-server/` |
| Core Engine | loot-core | Handler bridge: client → loot-core → HTTP → Express |
| Database | SQLite (account.sqlite) | Custom tables via sync-server migrations |
| AI | Ollama (VPS, 32GB RAM shared) | `mistral-small` default, `llama3.2-vision` for OCR |
| Infrastructure | Docker, GHCR CI/CD, VPS 212.69.84.228 | Self-hosted, full data sovereignty |
| Bank Sync | Docker sync scripts (community) | Max control, n8n integration pipeline |
| Mobile | PWA (Progressive Web App) | Same React codebase, responsive design |

## 3. Architecture Decisions (Locked)

### 3.1 Contract/Schedule Model
**ONE enriched contract object, layered on Actual's schedule engine.**

- A "contract" is the user-facing concept. Under the hood it references Actual's `schedule_id`.
- `contracts` table adds: type, notice_period, cancellation_date, auto_renewal, payment_history, documents, notes.
- Multiple payment events per contract: primary schedule (monthly) + additional_events (annual fees, one-time charges).
- Price changes logged with history. System detects amount mismatches from bank transactions.
- Contract with no payment (free trial) → `schedule_id = null`.

### 3.2 Category System
**Pre-built 2-level German category tree, customizable, with lightweight tags.**

Default tree:
| Level 1 | Level 2 |
|---------|---------|
| Wohnen | Miete, Nebenkosten, Strom, Gas, Internet, Hausrat, Renovierung |
| Mobilität | Auto-Versicherung, Tanken, Werkstatt, Leasing, ÖPNV, Taxi, Fahrrad |
| Lebensmittel | Supermarkt, Restaurant, Lieferdienst, Kaffee, Bäckerei, Markt |
| Freizeit | Streaming, Sport, Ausgehen, Hobbys, Reisen, Kultur, Bücher |
| Versicherungen | Kranken, Haftpflicht, Hausrat, BU, Rechtsschutz, KFZ, Leben |
| Finanzen | Sparen, Kredit-Tilgung, Zinsen, Gebühren, Investitionen |
| Gesundheit | Apotheke, Arzt, Brille, Zahnarzt, Fitness |
| Einkäufe | Kleidung, Elektronik, Möbel, Haushalt, Geschenke, Online |
| Bildung | Kurse, Software, Abonnements, Schule |
| Kinder | Betreuung, Kleidung, Schule, Spielzeug, Taschengeld |
| Sonstiges | Unkategorisiert, Bargeldabhebung, Gebühren, Sonstiges |
| Einkommen | Gehalt, Nebeneinkommen, Kindergeld, Zinserträge, Erstattungen |

- User can add 3rd level if needed (not pre-populated)
- Each L1 category has distinct color + icon
- Free-form tags: `Urlaub`, `Steuerlich relevant`, `Geteilt`, `Einmalig` (pre-suggested, user-extensible)
- Contracts bind to categories: all matched transactions inherit automatically
- IBAN-based categorization rules for German direct debits

### 3.3 AI Strategy — "Smart Matching"
**Three-tier system: Pinned → AI High Confidence → AI Low Confidence.**

| Tier | Trigger | Behavior | UX |
|------|---------|----------|-----|
| Pinned | User explicitly assigns | Deterministic default. Overridable per-transaction. | Lock icon |
| AI High (>85%) | Pattern + history | Auto-categorize silently | "AI" sparkle badge |
| AI Low (<85%) | New/rare payee | Auto-categorize + add to review queue | Yellow "?" indicator |

- Even pinned assignments can be overridden per-transaction
- AI learns from user corrections over time
- After 5 consistent categorizations for a payee, system suggests auto-pin
- After 95%+ accuracy over 10 transactions, auto-promote to silent processing

### 3.4 Unified Review Queue — "Needs Attention"
**All AI-generated items in one unified inbox.**

Item types: Uncategorized transactions, Recurring pattern detection, Amount anomalies, Budget suggestions.

Priority tiers: Urgent (red, e.g. potential overdraft) → Review (yellow, e.g. low-confidence AI) → Suggestions (blue, e.g. budget recommendation).

Key behaviors: Batch accept >90% confidence, delegation rules per-payee, undo stack, auto-dismiss when resolved, snooze with smart timing, weekly digest.

### 3.5 Bank Sync
**Docker sync scripts** (community approach, maximum control).

- Transactions route through n8n before import → AI categorization in pipeline
- Sync status dashboard with health monitoring
- Manual sync trigger + scheduled sync
- Transaction preview before commit with AI-suggested categories
- Amount mismatch detection against existing schedules

### 3.6 Mobile Strategy
**PWA first.** Same React codebase, responsive design. No native app until specific need arises (camera OCR, offline-first, biometric auth).

## 4. Feature Specifications

### 4.1 Operations Dashboard (Home Screen)

The cockpit is for MANAGING money, not ANALYZING it. No charts, no category breakdowns, no recent transactions on this page.

**Hero metrics:**
- **Total Balance**: Sum across all accounts
- **Available to Spend**: Total minus all committed future payments this month
- **Cash Runway**: Available / daily burn rate → "Money lasts until Mar 27"

**Layout (4-column):**
```
┌─ MONEY PULSE (dismissible) ──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ €2,325 total · €485 available · Runway: Mar 27 · ⚠ 3 reviews           │

└───────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

**Widgets (customizable via react-grid-layout in Phase 2):**
- Account Balances card
- "This Month" summary card
- Upcoming Payments list (configurable depth)
- Attention Queue
- Quick Add inline form
- Balance Projection chart
- Cash Runway indicator
- Money Pulse daily brief
- Budget Gauges (when budgets active)

**Money Pulse daily brief (top bar, dismissible):**
Three-line summary on app open:
"€2,325 total · No payments today · 3 items need review · This week: €976 · After: €1,349 available"

### 4.2 Contract & Recurring Payment Management

**Data model:**
```
Contract {
  // Identity
  id, name, provider, category_id, type (subscription|insurance|utility|loan|membership|other)

  // Primary payment (linked to Actual Schedule)
  schedule_id → Actual Schedule
  amount, interval (monthly|quarterly|semi-annual|annual|weekly|custom)
  next_payment_date, payment_account_id

  // Additional payment events
  additional_events: [{ description, amount, interval, month?, date?, one_time }]

  // Contract terms
  start_date, end_date, notice_period_months, auto_renewal (boolean)
  cancellation_deadline → computed: end_date - notice_period

  // Price history
  price_changes: [{ date, old_amount, new_amount, reason }]

  // Health
  status: active|expiring|cancelled|paused
  health: green|yellow|red (computed)

  // Meta
  notes, tags[], documents[], linked_transaction_ids[]
  iban, counterparty

  // Computed
  annual_cost, cost_per_day, total_increase_since_start
}
```

**List view features:**
- Health indicators: 🟢 (good) 🟡 (renewal in 60 days) 🔴 (cancellation deadline in 30 days)
- Sort by: name, amount, next payment, type, status, annual cost
- Filter by: type, status, category, account
- Group by: type, category, account
- Multi-select with Shift+click → "Selected: 5 contracts, €180/month"
- Monthly/Annual cost toggle display
- Cost-per-day display
- Total commitment summary card

**Contract templates (pre-built):**
Mietvertrag (12 months notice typical), Handyvertrag (24 months, 3 months notice), Stromvertrag (12 months, 6 weeks notice), Versicherung (varies), Streaming (monthly, cancel anytime), Fitnessstudio (12-24 months, 3 months notice).

**Contract creation flows:**
1. Manual: Click "+" → name, amount, interval, category (auto-suggest), optional fields on expand
2. AI-detected: After 3 recurring bank transactions → appears in review queue → one-click creation with pre-filled data
3. Bulk import: From Finanzguru export or during Getting Started wizard

**Price change handling:**
1. Bank transaction amount differs from schedule → review queue item
2. User clicks "Update to new amount" → schedule updates, change logged in history
3. Cashflow projections immediately use new amount

**Cancellation features:**
- Cancellation deadline computed and displayed prominently
- Deadline approaching → contract turns 🟡 then 🔴
- Cancellation letter template: pre-filled Kündigungsschreiben (name, address, contract number, date) for copy-paste

**Contract timeline visualization (Phase 3):**
Horizontal timeline showing all contracts across years with price changes and cancellation deadlines marked.

### 4.3 Payment Calendar / Cashflow Projection

**Default view:** Next 30 days, grouped by week, with running balance.

**Layout:**
- Week headers with total: "THIS WEEK — 3 items, €976"
- Each item: date, contract name, amount, account icon
- Running balance after each payment cluster
- "LATER" section collapsed (click to expand)
- Crunch day indicators: "March 1st: 5 payments, €1,240"
- Income entries (salary) shown in green, toggleable

**Views available:**
- Next 30 days (default, grouped by week)
- Full month grid (calendar view)
- Full year overview
- Payday cycle toggle (27th→26th instead of 1st→last)

**Balance projection:**
- Running balance from today forward
- Shows balance at each payment cluster
- Income (salary on predictable date) included
- Balance corridor: red zone when below user-set threshold (e.g., €500 buffer)

**Scenario mode (Phase 3):**
Drag payments to different dates → see how projection changes.

### 4.4 Quick Add Expense

**Base flow (3-4 seconds):** Amount → Category → Save.

**Layout:**
```
┌─ QUICK ADD (⌘N) ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PRESETS: [☕ 3.80] [🛒 Supermarkt] [🍕 Restaurant] [📸 OCR] │
│  Amount: [€________] ← calculator: "12.50+8.30" works        │
│  Category: [________] ← fuzzy search + frecency              │
│  ─── expand (Tab) ────────                                    │
│  Payee: [____]  Notes: [____]  Account: [Cash ▾]  Date: [▾]  │
│  ┌─ RECENT: [REWE -34.50] [Bäcker -5.80] [Taxi -18] ────┐   │
│  [Save ↵] [Save+New ⌘↵] [Save+Dup ⌘⇧↵] [Park ⌘P]          │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
| Feature | Shortcut | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Preset buttons | Click | User-pinned + auto-learned from frequency (coexist) |
| Save + New | ⌘+Enter | Save and open fresh form |
| Save + Duplicate | ⌘+Shift+Enter | Save and open with same category |
| Park for Later | ⌘+P | Save amount only as draft, categorize later |
| Recent templates | Click | Clone recent transaction as new entry |
| Calculator | Type math | "12.50+8.30" computes in amount field |
| Smart Amount | Auto | Pre-fills typical amount when category selected |
| +/- toggle | Click | Default expense, toggle for income |
| Photo attach | 📎 / 📸 | Camera or file upload, OCR if enabled |
| Fuzzy search | Type | "Kaf" → "Kaffee" with frecency |
| Expense Train | ⌘T | Rapid multi-entry mode with running total |

**"Park for Later" system:**
Drafts appear in attention queue. AI suggests categories based on: time of day (morning → Bäckerei), amount patterns (€3-5 → Kaffee), user history. "Accept All AI" for batch categorization.

**"Expense Train" mode:**
Rapid sequential entry with visible running total. All items saved at once to default account.

### 4.5 Invoice OCR

**Use Case A — Cash receipt scan (Phase 2):**
1. Camera button in Quick Add (mobile) or drag-drop zone (desktop)
2. Image uploaded to VPS → Ollama llama3.2-vision processes
3. Extraction: amount (90%+), date (90%+), vendor (70-80%)
4. Pre-filled Quick Add form with receipt thumbnail
5. Side-by-side: receipt image with highlighted extraction regions + extracted data
6. User confirms/adjusts → Save with receipt attached

**Use Case B — Digital invoice linking (Phase 2):**
1. On contract detail page: "Upload invoice" / drag PDF
2. OCR extracts: amount, date, invoice number
3. "This matches Vodafone contract (€39.90/month). Link?" → Confirm

**Use Case C — Receipt-to-transaction matching (Phase 2):**
Receipt inbox: unmatched receipts waiting for bank transaction. When match found → auto-link suggestion.

**Use Case D — Email forwarding (Phase 3):**
Forward invoice email → n8n processes → draft appears in review queue.

**Technical constraints:**
- llama3.2-vision 11B needs ~8GB RAM. On 32GB shared VPS → may need smaller model or request queuing.
- Always show for review — never auto-save from OCR.

### 4.6 Data Migration & Import

**Getting Started wizard (first-run):**
1. CREATE ACCOUNTS: Add bank accounts, credit cards, cash wallet, PayPal
2. IMPORT DATA: [Finanzguru XLSX] [Bank CSV] [Skip]
3. SET UP BANK SYNC: [Configure Docker sync] [Later]
4. REVIEW CONTRACTS: "23 recurring payments detected. Verify and enrich."
5. CUSTOMIZE CATEGORIES: [German defaults] [Map from Finanzguru] [Customize]

**Finanzguru import wizard:**
- Upload XLSX export (columns: Hauptkategorie, Unterkategorie, transaction fields, contract info)
- Auto-map Finanzguru categories to our tree (with manual override)
- Import transactions, detect recurring patterns
- Preview before committing

**Bank CSV import:**
- Auto-detect German bank format: DKB, ING, Sparkasse, Commerzbank, N26, Comdirect, Deutsche Bank
- Handle encoding (Windows-1252) and separator (semicolon) issues
- Smart deduplication against already-imported transactions

**Import advisor:**
"234 transactions detected. 189 can be auto-categorized. 23 look like contracts. 22 need manual review. [Import]"

**Additional formats (Phase 2):**
- MT940 (SWIFT German bank statement)
- CAMT.053 (ISO 20022 XML)

### 4.7 Statistics / Analytics

Separate page from dashboard. NOT operational — analytical.

**Core views (Phase 2):**
| View | Description |
|------|------------|
| Spending by Category | Bar/pie/treemap with L1→L2 drill-down |
| Monthly Overview | Income vs expenses waterfall, net savings trend |
| Fixed vs Variable | Committed (contracts) vs discretionary breakdown |
| Spending Trends | Line chart per category over time |
| Budget vs Actual | Per-category comparison (when budgets set up) |
| "What Changed?" | This month vs last month, biggest deltas |
| Top Merchants | "€2,340 at REWE this year, €890 at Amazon" |

**Advanced views (Phase 3):**
- Subscription creep tracker (total subscriptions over time)
- Spending velocity ("At current pace: €3,100 this month")
- Seasonal patterns ("More in Dec and Aug")
- Merchant loyalty ("REWE 3.2x/week, avg €38")
- Year-over-year comparison
- Cost of living trend (core costs over 12 months)
- Annual report PDF export

**All views:** Time range selector (month, quarter, year, custom, YoY comparison).

### 4.8 Budgeting (Progressive, Phase 2+)

- Envelope-style: assign money to categories
- Rollover: unspent budget rolls (configurable per category)
- Hero metric: "Left to spend" = budget - committed - already spent
- Budget alerts: "Essen 85% used, 10 days left"
- AI budget suggestions from 3-month spending average
- Savings goals with progress bars (Phase 3)

### 4.9 Loan Tracking (Phase 3)

- Loan IS a contract with type "Kredit" + additional fields
- Additional fields: principal, interest_rate, term_months, remaining_balance
- Tilgungsplan visualization: each payment → principal, interest, remaining
- Loan overview card: original amount, current balance, monthly payment, remaining term
- Early repayment calculator: "Pay €200 extra → save €X interest, finish Y months early"

## 5. Global UX Patterns

### 5.1 Command Palette (⌘K)
Extends existing `CommandBar.tsx` (cmdk v1.1.1).

**Modes:**
| Mode | Trigger | Function |
|------|---------|----------|
| Search | Type anything | Transactions, contracts, payees, categories |
| Navigate | Type page name | Go to any page |
| Actions | Type ">" | `> add`, `> contract`, `> review`, `> sync` |
| Calculator | Type "=" | `= 3200 - 1840` → shows result |
| Transaction search | "€89" or "REWE" | Find by amount or payee |
| Contract search | Contract name | Show details inline with quick actions |

Context-sensitive: on contracts page → contract actions surface first.

### 5.2 Keyboard Shortcuts
Uses `react-hotkeys-hook` (already installed).

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘K | Command palette |
| ⌘N | Quick add expense |
| ⌘T | Expense train mode |
| ⌘1-9 | Navigate to page |
| J / K | Navigate up/down in lists |
| Enter | Open selected item |
| E | Edit selected item inline |
| Esc | Close overlay / go back |
| ⌘Z | Undo last action |
| ? | Show keyboard shortcuts reference |

### 5.3 Navigation Structure
```
⌘1  Dashboard        ← Operations cockpit
⌘2  Accounts         ← Account list + transactions
⌘3  Contracts        ← All recurring payments
⌘4  Calendar         ← Payment timeline
⌘5  Budget           ← Envelope budgets
⌘6  Analytics        ← Charts + reports
⌘7  Import           ← Bank sync + data import
⌘8  Review (badge)   ← AI review queue
⌘9  Settings         ← Configuration

Always available (overlays, not pages):
⌘N  Quick Add
⌘K  Command Palette
```

**Progressive feature discovery:**
- First visit: Dashboard + Accounts + Import. Others dimmed with unlock hints.
- After import: Contracts + Calendar activate
- After AI processes: Review queue appears
- After budgets set: Budget page activates

### 5.4 Micro-Interactions (Premium Feel)

| Pattern | Description | Phase |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Inline editing | Click amount/category in lists → edit in place | 1 |
| Bulk select | Shift+Click range → batch categorize/tag/delete | 1 |
| Toast + Undo | Every action → "Saved" toast with 10-sec undo | 1 |
| Skeleton loading | Gray pulsing shapes (not spinners) | 1 |
| Smooth transitions | Cards slide in, dismissed items fade out | 1 |
| Color-coded amounts | Expenses red, income green, transfers gray | 1 |
| Empty state guidance | "No contracts yet. [Import] or [Add first]" | 1 |
| "Last visited" memory | App reopens to last page | 1 |
| Breadcrumbs | Dashboard > Contracts > FitX | 1 |
| Amount formatting | Auto €, comma decimals (German), thousand seps | 1 |
| Fuzzy search | Everywhere: contracts, payees, categories, notes | 1 |
| Context menus | Right-click → quick actions | 2 |
| Smart date input | "morgen", "letzten Freitag" → parsed (German) | 2 |
| Density toggle | Comfortable / Dense / Compact | 2 |
| Drag-and-drop | Categorize by dragging transactions | 2 |
| Dashboard widget customization | react-grid-layout drag/resize | 2 |

### 5.5 Design Token Refresh

Update `packages/component-library/src/theme.ts`:
- Modern color palette (inspired by Linear/Superhuman, not "2011 open source")
- Consistent spacing scale: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48px
- Typography: Inter (already used), refined size/weight scale
- Subtle shadows and border-radius for premium card feel
- Smooth hover/focus transitions
- Color-coded categories with distinct hues per L1

## 6. Phase Plan

### Backlog

- Native mobile app (React Native)
- Investment/portfolio tracking
- Multi-currency
- Data export for accountant/loan applications
- n8n advanced automation workflows
- Custom themes
- Crawl4AI integration

## 7. Unique Differentiators

1. **Progressive AI Automation ("Autopilot")**: The app gets smarter every day. Review queue shrinks from 20/week to 2-3/week. No competitor does this.

2. **Financial Pulse**: AI-generated daily brief + weekly digest + monthly snapshot. The app TALKS to you about your money.

3. **German-First, Self-Hosted**: Full data sovereignty. IBAN-based matching. German category tree. Kündigungsfristen. German bank CSV formats. German receipt OCR. No third-party data access.

## 8. What to Kill / Deprecate

From the existing fork, these modules should be **deprecated or removed**:
- `packages/sync-server/src/intelligence/` — too abstract, no daily utility. Replaced by review queue.
- `packages/sync-server/src/nl-query/` — cool tech, zero daily utility. Replaced by command palette.
- `packages/sync-server/src/events/` — over-engineered event bus for current scale. Use direct function calls.
- `packages/sync-server/src/documents/` — replaced by simpler invoice OCR scope (Phase 2).
- `packages/sync-server/src/forecast/` — replaced by simpler balance projection on calendar.

**Keep and enhance:**
- `packages/sync-server/src/ai/` — refocus on Smart Matching three-tier system
- `packages/sync-server/src/contracts/` — rebuild as the enriched contract model
